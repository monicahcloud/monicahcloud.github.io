 I am a data driven professional with a background in data visualization and analytics. I am a curious, open-minded, and explorative individual with strong problem solving skills and attention to detail. I am experienced in Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau and R. I excel at working individually or with team members to meet and exceed organizational goals. I am resilient, resourceful, and operate well in an environment that’s ever changing. I am a quick learner and hard worker that actively seeks more knowledge, growth, and self-development.

In my former role as an Educator, I exercised logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions or approaches to problems, identified measures or indicators of system performance and the actions needed to improve or correct performance relative to the goals of the system, and juggled multiple tasks and responsibilities while remaining composed and meeting deadlines.
